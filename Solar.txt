										SolarCell Tracking System



System definition: Solarcell panel with 4 LDR sensors each one fix in each corner of panel and we use two servo motor one control direction of panel and other

servo fix in column that carry all body.





System Inputs:
 4 LDR sensor


System Output

 2 Servo motors




Alograthim : Simple alograthim and make for specific condtions  as we consdier the the sum of upper two sensors is larger or lower with lower two sensors

 that make stepper of panel change direction by low PWM until become two of them equal and same time compare the right sensors with left LDR sensors
 
and check the equal or not then action happen

and we take in consideration 0.5v error is acccept in comparsion.


Note

we applyied concept of  code generation and make simulation in proteus.
